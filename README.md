# StrolchBot
A fork of the famous Twitch Bot that was originally created for channel DerHauge, which is used at channel indiestrolche. 

### Vote Bot

Checks every chat message for the following beginnings:

results in | trigger
--- | ---
neutral | `+-` `-+` `+/-` `-/+` `haugeNeutral`  
plus | `+` `haugePlus`  
minus | `-` `haugeMinus`  

Posts an interim result every 20 seconds and an end result after 5 seconds of no additional votes.

Checks if more than 10 votes have been added before posting any result.


### Giveaway Bot

    !giveaway-open [mod-only] -> Resets the entry-list and open the giveaway
